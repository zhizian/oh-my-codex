# Codex native hook mapping

This page is the canonical answer to:

> Which OMC/OMX hooks run on native Codex hooks already, which stay on runtime fallbacks, and which are not supported yet?

## Install surface

`omx setup` now owns both of these native Codex artifacts:

- `.codex/config.toml` → enables `[features].codex_hooks = true`
- `.codex/hooks.json` → registers the OMX-managed native hook command

For project scope, `.gitignore` keeps generated `.codex/hooks.json` out of source control.

## Ownership split

- **Native Codex hooks**: `.codex/hooks.json`
- **OMX plugin hooks**: `.omx/hooks/*.mjs`
- **tmux/runtime fallbacks**: `omx tmux-hook`, notify-hook, derived watcher, idle/session-end reporters

## Mapping matrix

| OMC / OMX surface | Native Codex source | OMX runtime target | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `session-start` | `SessionStart` | `session-start` | native | Native adapter refreshes session bookkeeping, restores startup developer context, and ensures `.omx/` is gitignored at the repo root |
| `keyword-detector` | `UserPromptSubmit` | `keyword-detector` | native | Persists skill activation state and can add prompt-side developer context |
| `pre-tool-use` | `PreToolUse` (`Bash`) | `pre-tool-use` | native-partial | Current native scope is Bash-only; built-in native behavior is a narrow destructive-command caution via `systemMessage` |
| `post-tool-use` | `PostToolUse` (`Bash`) | `post-tool-use` | native-partial | Current native scope is Bash-only; built-in native behavior covers command-not-found / permission-denied / missing-path guidance and informative non-zero-output review |
| Ralph/persistence stop handling | `Stop` | `stop` | native-partial | Native adapter uses the documented native Stop continuation contract (`decision: "block"` + `reason`) for active Ralph runs and avoids re-blocking once `stop_hook_active` is set |
| Autopilot continuation | `Stop` | `stop` | native-partial | Native adapter continues non-terminal autopilot sessions from active session/root mode state |
| Ultrawork continuation | `Stop` | `stop` | native-partial | Native adapter continues non-terminal ultrawork sessions from active session/root mode state |
| UltraQA continuation | `Stop` | `stop` | native-partial | Native adapter continues non-terminal ultraqa sessions from active session/root mode state |
| Team-phase continuation | `Stop` | `stop` | native-partial | Native adapter treats per-team `phase.json` as canonical when deciding whether a current-session team run is still non-terminal |
| `ralplan` skill-state continuation | `Stop` | `stop` | native-partial | Native adapter can block on active `skill-active-state.json` for `ralplan`, unless active subagents are already the real in-flight owners |
| `deep-interview` skill-state continuation | `Stop` | `stop` | native-partial | Native adapter can block on active `skill-active-state.json` for `deep-interview`, unless active subagents are already the real in-flight owners |
| auto-nudge continuation | `Stop` | `stop` | native-partial | Native adapter continues turns that end in a permission/stall prompt, unless the Stop hook already continued once |
| `ask-user-question` | none | runtime-only | runtime-fallback | No distinct Codex native hook today |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | none | runtime-only | runtime-fallback | Fold into runtime/fallback handling until native support exists |
| non-Bash tool interception | none | runtime-only | runtime-fallback | Current Codex native tool hooks expose Bash only |
| code simplifier stop follow-up | none | runtime-only | runtime-fallback | Cleanup follow-up stays on runtime/fallback surfaces, not native Stop |
| `SubagentStop` | none | runtime-only | not-supported-yet | OMC-specific lifecycle extension |
| `session-end` | none | `session-end` | runtime-fallback | Still emitted from runtime/notify path, not native Codex hooks |
| `session-idle` | none | `session-idle` | runtime-fallback | Still emitted from runtime/notify path, not native Codex hooks |

## Verification guidance

When validating hooks, keep the proof boundary explicit:

1. **Native Codex hook proof**
   - `omx setup` wrote `.codex/hooks.json`
   - native Codex event invoked `dist/scripts/codex-native-hook.js`
2. **OMX plugin proof**
   - plugin dispatch/log evidence exists under `.omx/logs/hooks-*.jsonl`
3. **Fallback proof**
   - behavior came from notify-hook / derived watcher / tmux runtime, not native Codex hooks

Do not claim “native hooks work” when only tmux or synthetic notify fallback paths were exercised.
