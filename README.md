OMX turns Codex from a single-session agent into a coordinated system with:
- Role prompts (`/prompts:name`) for specialized agents
- Workflow skills (`$name`) for repeatable execution modes
- Team orchestration (`omx team`, `$team`) with tmux interactive mode (default) or non-tmux prompt mode
- Persistent state + memory via MCP servers

## Why OMX

Codex CLI is strong for direct tasks. OMX adds structure for larger work:
- Decomposition and staged execution (`team-plan -> team-prd -> team-exec -> team-verify -> team-fix`)
- Persistent mode lifecycle state (`.omx/state/`)
- Memory + notepad surfaces for long-running sessions
- Operational controls for launch, verification, and cancellation

OMX is an add-on, not a fork. It uses Codex-native extension points.

## Positioning: CLI-first orchestration, MCP-backed state

OMX is best used as an **outer CLI orchestration layer**:
- **Control plane (CLI/runtime):** `omx team`, tmux workers, lifecycle commands
- **Capability/state plane (MCP):** task state, mailbox, memory, diagnostics tools

Practical mode split:
- **`$team` / `omx team`**: durable, inspectable, resumable multi-worker execution with live lanes, shared blockers, and visible handoff / rebalancing when one worker gets stuck
- **`$ultrawork`**: lightweight parallel fanout for independent tasks (component mode)

Why team mode exists even when ultrawork already exists:
- Use **ultrawork** when tasks are mostly independent and the leader can merge results afterward.
- Use **team mode** when the work benefits from shared situational awareness: workers can discover blockers early, hand work across lanes, and keep execution visible through tmux panes plus durable state.
- Team mode is the better fit for orchestration-heavy or edge-case-heavy work where runtime control, recovery, and inspectability matter as much as raw fanout.

Low-token team profile example:

```bash
OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI=codex \
OMX_TEAM_WORKER_LAUNCH_ARGS='--model gpt-5.3-codex-spark -c model_reasoning_effort="low"' \
omx team 2:explore "short scoped analysis task"
```

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 20 (CI validates Node 20 and current LTS, currently Node 22)
- Codex CLI installed (`npm install -g @openai/codex`)
- Codex auth configured

### Platform & tmux

OMX features like `omx team` require **tmux**:

| Platform       | tmux provider                                            | Install                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| macOS          | [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)                    | `brew install tmux`    |
| Ubuntu/Debian  | tmux                                                     | `sudo apt install tmux`|
| Fedora         | tmux                                                     | `sudo dnf install tmux`|
| Arch           | tmux                                                     | `sudo pacman -S tmux`  |
| Windows        | [psmux](https://github.com/marlocarlo/psmux) (native)   | `winget install psmux` |
| Windows (WSL2) | tmux (inside WSL)                                        | `sudo apt install tmux`|

> **Windows users:** [psmux](https://github.com/marlocarlo/psmux) provides a native `tmux` binary for Windows with 76 tmux-compatible commands. No WSL required.

## Quickstart (3 minutes)

```bash
npm install -g oh-my-codex
omx setup
omx doctor
```

Recommended trusted-environment launch profile:

```bash
omx --xhigh --madmax
```

## New in v0.5.0

- **Scope-aware setup** with `omx setup --scope user|project` for flexible install modes.
- **Spark worker routing** via `--spark` / `--madmax-spark` so team workers can use `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` without forcing the leader model.
- **Catalog consolidation** — removed deprecated prompts (`deep-executor`, `scientist`) and 9 deprecated skills for a leaner surface.
- **Notifier verbosity levels** for fine-grained CCNotifier output control.

## First Session

Inside Codex:

```text
/prompts:architect "analyze current auth boundaries"
/prompts:executor "implement input validation in login"
$plan "ship OAuth callback safely"
$team 3:executor "fix all TypeScript errors"
```

From terminal:

```bash
omx team 4:executor "parallelize a multi-module refactor"
omx team status <team-name>
omx team shutdown <team-name>
```

## Core Model

OMX installs and wires these layers:

```text
User
  -> Codex CLI
    -> AGENTS.md (orchestration brain)
    -> ~/.codex/prompts/*.md (installable active/internal agent prompt catalog)
    -> ~/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md (skill catalog)
    -> ~/.codex/config.toml (features, notify, MCP)
    -> .omx/ (runtime state, memory, plans, logs)
```

## Experimental: posture-aware routing

This branch includes an experimental routing layer that separates:

- `role`: agent responsibility (`executor`, `planner`, `architect`)
- `tier`: reasoning depth / cost (`LOW`, `STANDARD`, `THOROUGH`)
- `posture`: operating style (`frontier-orchestrator`, `deep-worker`, `fast-lane`)

Current intent of the experiment:

- **Frontier-orchestrator**: leader/router posture for steerable frontier models
- **Deep-worker**: implementation-first posture for executor-style roles
- **Fast-lane**: lightweight triage/search posture for fast models

This is designed to make OMX's initial routing behavior more Sisyphus-like without removing the existing Hephaestus-like execution lane.

### How to test this experiment

1. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Reinstall native agent configs:

```bash
node bin/omx.js setup
```

3. Inspect generated native agent configs in `~/.omx/agents/` and confirm they now include:
   - `## OMX Posture Overlay`
   - `## Model-Class Guidance`
   - `## OMX Agent Metadata`

4. Spot-check representative roles:
   - `planner` / `architect` / `critic` -> `frontier-orchestrator`
   - `executor` / `build-fixer` / `test-engineer` -> `deep-worker`
   - `explore` / `writer` -> `fast-lane`

5. Run focused tests:

```bash
node --test dist/agents/__tests__/definitions.test.js dist/agents/__tests__/native-config.test.js
```

This experiment currently changes native prompt generation and metadata, not the full prose of every prompt file.

## Main Commands

```bash
omx                # Launch Codex (+ HUD in tmux when available)
omx setup          # Install prompts/skills/config by scope + project .omx (AGENTS.md only for project scope)
omx doctor         # Installation/runtime diagnostics
omx doctor --team  # Team/swarm diagnostics
omx ask ...        # Ask local provider advisor (claude|gemini), writes .omx/artifacts/*
omx team ...       # Start/status/resume/shutdown team workers (interactive tmux by default)
omx ralph          # Launch Codex with ralph persistence mode active
omx status         # Show active modes
omx cancel         # Cancel active execution modes
omx reasoning <mode> # low|medium|high|xhigh
omx tmux-hook ...  # init|status|validate|test
omx hooks ...      # init|status|validate|test (plugin extension workflow)
omx hud ...        # --watch|--json|--preset
omx version        # Show version information
omx help           # Show help message
```

Ask command examples:

```bash
omx ask claude "review this diff"
omx ask gemini "brainstorm alternatives"
omx ask claude --agent-prompt executor "implement feature X with tests"
omx ask gemini --agent-prompt=planner --prompt "draft a rollout plan"
# underlying provider flags from CLI help:
# claude -p|--print "<prompt>"
# gemini -p|--prompt "<prompt>"
```

Non-tmux team launch (advanced):

```bash
OMX_TEAM_WORKER_LAUNCH_MODE=prompt omx team 2:executor "task"
```

## Hooks Extension (Additive Surface)

OMX now includes `omx hooks` for plugin scaffolding and validation.

- `omx tmux-hook` remains supported and unchanged.
- `omx hooks` is additive and does not replace tmux-hook workflows.
- Plugin files live at `.omx/hooks/*.mjs`.
- Plugins are off by default; enable with `OMX_HOOK_PLUGINS=1`.

See `docs/hooks-extension.md` for the full extension workflow and event model.

## Launch Flags

```bash
--yolo              # Launch Codex in yolo mode
--high              # High reasoning effort (shorthand for -c model_reasoning_effort="high")
--xhigh             # xhigh reasoning effort (shorthand for -c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh")
--madmax            # DANGEROUS: bypass Codex approvals and sandbox
--spark             # Use Codex spark model for team workers only (~1.3x faster)
--madmax-spark      # spark model for workers + bypass approvals for leader and workers
-w, --worktree[=<name>]  # Launch Codex in a git worktree (detached when no name given)
--force             # Enable destructive maintenance (for example stale/deprecated skill cleanup)
--dry-run           # Show what would be done without doing it
--keep-config       # Skip config.toml cleanup during uninstall
--purge             # Remove .omx/ cache directory during uninstall
--verbose           # Show detailed output
--scope <user|project>  # setup only
```

`--madmax` maps to Codex `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.
Use it only in trusted/external sandbox environments.

### MCP workingDirectory policy (optional hardening)

By default, MCP state/memory/trace tools accept caller-provided `workingDirectory`.
To constrain this, set an allowlist of roots:

```bash
export OMX_MCP_WORKDIR_ROOTS="/path/to/project:/path/to/another-root"
```

When set, `workingDirectory` values outside these roots are rejected.

## Codex-First Prompt Control

By default, OMX injects:

```text
-c model_instructions_file="<cwd>/AGENTS.md"
```

This layers project `AGENTS.md` guidance into Codex launch instructions.
It extends Codex behavior, but does not replace/bypass Codex core system policies.

Controls:

```bash
OMX_BYPASS_DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT=0 omx     # disable AGENTS.md injection
OMX_MODEL_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE=/path/to/instructions.md omx
```

## Team Mode

Use team mode for broad work that benefits from parallel workers.

Lifecycle:

```text
start -> assign scoped lanes -> monitor -> verify terminal tasks -> shutdown
```

Operational commands:

```bash
omx team <args>
omx team --help
omx team api --help
omx team status <team-name>
omx team resume <team-name>
omx team shutdown <team-name>
```

Important rule: do not shutdown while tasks are still `in_progress` unless aborting.

### Recommended high-control workflow: `ralplan -> team -> ralph`

For contributors who want tighter control than `autopilot` but more coordination than `$ultrawork`, the strongest workflow is:

```text
ralplan -> team -> ralph
```

Why this combination works well:
- **`ralplan`** turns a rough request into a spec, acceptance checks, and a lane-ready breakdown before workers start.
- **`$team`** executes that plan with durable worker coordination, visible runtime state, and better handling of blockers than simple fanout.
- **`$ralph`** keeps the loop alive until verification is real, evidence is fresh, and cleanup is explicit.

In practice, this is the right workflow when you want to stay in control of planning and orchestration while still getting parallel execution. `autopilot` can chain these modes for you, but advanced users will often prefer running the sequence directly so they can tune worker roles, follow-up stages, and verification thresholds themselves.

Example:

```bash
omx ask --agent-prompt planner "ralplan: break this feature into worker lanes and acceptance checks"
omx team 3:executor "execute the approved ralplan with shared runtime coordination"
```

Planned documentation/product direction: make `ralplan` produce stronger team follow-up guidance by default, including worker placement hints and an explicit follow-up path such as `--followup team`.

### Ralph Cleanup Policy

When a team runs in ralph mode (`omx team ralph ...`), the shutdown cleanup
applies a dedicated policy that differs from the normal path:

| Behavior | Normal team | Ralph team |
|---|---|---|
| Force shutdown on failure | Throws `shutdown_gate_blocked` | Bypasses gate, logs `ralph_cleanup_policy` event |
| Auto branch deletion | Deletes worktree branches on rollback | Preserves branches (`skipBranchDeletion`) |
| Completion logging | Standard `shutdown_gate` event | Additional `ralph_cleanup_summary` event with task breakdown |

The ralph policy is auto-detected from team mode state (`linked_ralph`) or
can be passed explicitly via `omx team shutdown <name> --ralph`.

Worker CLI selection for team workers:

```bash
OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI=auto    # default; uses claude when worker --model contains "claude"
OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI=codex   # force Codex CLI workers
OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI=claude  # force Claude CLI workers
OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI_MAP=codex,codex,claude,claude  # per-worker CLI mix (len=1 or worker count)
OMX_TEAM_AUTO_INTERRUPT_RETRY=0  # optional: disable adaptive queue->resend fallback
```

Notes:
- Worker launch args are still shared via `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_LAUNCH_ARGS` for model/config inheritance.
- `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI_MAP` overrides `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_CLI` for per-worker selection.
- Team mode now allocates `model_reasoning_effort` per teammate from the resolved worker role (`low` / `medium` / `high`) unless an explicit reasoning override already exists in `OMX_TEAM_WORKER_LAUNCH_ARGS`.
- When a worker resolves to a concrete task role, OMX composes a per-worker startup instructions file that layers the corresponding role prompt on top of the shared team worker protocol; explicit `model_instructions_file` launch overrides still win.
- Trigger submission uses adaptive retries by default (queue/submit, then safe clear-line+resend fallback when needed).
- In Claude worker mode, OMX spawns workers as plain `claude` (no extra launch args) and ignores explicit `--model` / `--config` / `--effort` overrides so Claude uses default `settings.json`.

## What `omx setup` writes

- `.omx/setup-scope.json` (persisted setup scope)
- Scope-dependent installs:
  - `user`: `~/.codex/prompts/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.omx/agents/`
  - `project`: `./.codex/prompts/`, `./.agents/skills/`, `./.codex/config.toml`, `./.omx/agents/`
- Launch behavior: if persisted scope is `project`, `omx` launch auto-uses `CODEX_HOME=./.codex` (unless `CODEX_HOME` is already set).
- Managed OMX artifacts refresh by default in both interactive and non-interactive runs: prompts, skills, native agent configs, and the managed OMX portion of `config.toml`
- Project `AGENTS.md` is only generated/refreshed for `project` scope; `user` scope leaves any existing project `AGENTS.md` unchanged
- If a managed file differs and will be overwritten, setup creates a backup first under `.omx/backups/setup/<timestamp>/...` (project scope) or `~/.omx/backups/setup/<timestamp>/...` (user scope)
- Active-session safety still blocks `AGENTS.md` overwrite while an OMX session is running
- `config.toml` updates (for both scopes):
  - `notify = ["node", "..."]`
  - `model_reasoning_effort = "high"`
  - `developer_instructions = "..."`
  - `model = "gpt-5.4"` when root `model` is absent
  - if the existing root model is `gpt-5.3-codex`, interactive `omx setup` asks whether to upgrade it to `gpt-5.4`; non-interactive runs preserve the existing model
  - `model_context_window = 1000000` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit = 900000` only when the effective root model is `gpt-5.4` and both context keys are absent
  - `[features] multi_agent = true, child_agents_md = true`
  - MCP server entries (`omx_state`, `omx_memory`, `omx_code_intel`, `omx_trace`)
  - `[tui] status_line`
- Project `AGENTS.md` (project scope only)
- `.omx/` runtime directories and HUD config
- Default setup output includes a compact per-category refresh summary; `--verbose` adds changed-file detail
- `--force` is reserved for stronger maintenance behavior such as stale/deprecated skill cleanup; it is no longer required for ordinary refresh
- The 1M GPT-5.4 context settings are experimental and can increase usage because requests beyond the standard context budget may count more heavily

## Agents and Skills

- Prompts: `prompts/*.md` (installed to `~/.codex/prompts/` for `user`, `./.codex/prompts/` for `project`)
- Skills: `skills/*/SKILL.md` (installed to `~/.agents/skills/` for `user`, `./.agents/skills/` for `project`)

Examples:
- Agents: `architect`, `planner`, `executor`, `debugger`, `verifier`, `security-reviewer`
- Skills: `autopilot`, `plan`, `team`, `ralph`, `ultrawork`, `cancel`

### Notification Setup Skill (`$configure-notifications`)

Use `$configure-notifications` as the unified entry point for notification setup:

- Discord (webhook/bot)
- Telegram (bot)
- Slack (webhook)
- OpenClaw / custom webhook / custom CLI command

Examples:

```text
$configure-notifications "configure discord notifications"
$configure-notifications "configure slack notifications"
$configure-notifications "configure openclaw notifications"
```

For OpenClaw with **clawdbot agent turns** (instead of direct message forwarding),
configure a command gateway using `clawdbot agent --deliver --reply-channel ... --reply-to ...`
and map hook events (`session-start`, `session-idle`, `ask-user-question`, `session-stop`, `session-end`).

For dev teams using `#omc-dev`, the OpenClaw guide includes a dedicated runbook for:
- Korean-only hook responses
- `sessionId` + `tmuxSession` tracing
- `SOUL.md`-based follow-up workflow

See: `docs/openclaw-integration.md` (Dev Guide section).

Required env gates for OpenClaw command mode:

```bash
export OMX_OPENCLAW=1
export OMX_OPENCLAW_COMMAND=1
```

### Visual QA Loop (`$visual-verdict`)

Use `$visual-verdict` when a task depends on visual fidelity (reference image(s) + generated screenshot).

- Return structured JSON: `score`, `verdict`, `category_match`, `differences[]`, `suggestions[]`, `reasoning`
- Recommended pass threshold: **90+**
- For visual tasks, run `$visual-verdict` every iteration before the next edit
- Use pixel diff / pixelmatch overlays as **secondary debugging aids** (not the primary pass/fail signal)
